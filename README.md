# Schemas

This repository is used to define schemas for Verifiable Credentials, on things that haven't been standardized yet. Anyone is welcome to comment on the proposed schemas and/or propose improvements.

Our goal is for this repository to become useless eventually, as a consensus emerges among the Internet community for all kinds of information that don't have a standard schema yet.
